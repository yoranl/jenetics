# Jenetics extension module

This module contains additional genes and chromosomes which are somehow _not standard_. The main reason for this division is the desire to keep the `org.jenetics.base` module as small as possible.

## Genes and chromosomes

* `BigIntegerGene`
* `BigIntegerChromosome`
* `TreeGene`
* `TreeChromosome`

## Operators

* `WeaselMutator`
* `WeaselSelector`
* `SimulatedBinaryCrossover`
* `SingleNodeCrossover`

## Util classes

* `Tree`: General tree implementation; needed for the `org.jenetics.prog` module.
